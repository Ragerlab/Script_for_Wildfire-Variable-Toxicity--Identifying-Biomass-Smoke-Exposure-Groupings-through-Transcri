Output is broken up into three folders based on the criteria used to determine significantly differentially expressed genes. Each analysis contains the differntially expressed genes at 4h and 24h based on the selected criteria, as well as the lower triangular matrix of Jaccard similarities between pairwise exposure conditions based on a binarization of the transcriptome with genes identified as significantly differentially expressed, or not significantly differnetially expressed.

- FC_1_5 contains analysis with differntially expressed genes identified as genes that were significant with an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change of >= 1.5
- FC_2 contains analysis with differntially expressed genes identified as genes that were significant with an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change of >= 2
- FC_2_5 contains analysis with differntially expressed genes identified as genes that were significant with an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change of >= 2.5
