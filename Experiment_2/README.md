Experiment 2 identifies which genes are differentially expressed at 4hs and at 24hs using filters of an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >=2.5. Gene expression for each condition is binarized according to whether the gene is significantly differentially expressed for that condition at the given timepoint. Hierearchical clustering is run to group both the exposure conditions, and the genes using the Jaccard distance, and heatmaps of the results are produced along with the lower triangular matrices of pairwise Jaccard similarities between exposure conditions. Heatmaps of present toxicity markers are also generated, as well as lists of genes that are significant in each cluster of exposure conditions.
