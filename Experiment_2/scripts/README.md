Scripts in this experiment include:
- **4h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_2_5.R**: Runs hierarchical clustering on both exposure conditions, and genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 2.5 using the Jaccard distance, then makes heatmaps of results. A heatmap of toxicity markers for each exposure condition at 4h is generated and organized to match the order of the clustered exposure condition/gene heatmap. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwise Jaccard similarities is exported, as well as lists of genes that are significantly differentially expressed in each cluster of exposure conditions. 
- **24h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_2_5.R**: Runs hierarchical clustering on both exposure conditions, and genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 24hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 2.5 using the Jaccard distance, then makes heatmaps of results. A heatmap of toxicity markers for each exposure condition at 24h is generated and organized to match the order of the clustered exposure condition/gene heatmap. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwasie Jaccard similarities is exported, as well as lists of genes that are significantly differentially expressed in each cluster of exposure conditions. 
- **sig_genes_4h.R**: Produces list of genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4h, and for which exposure conditions
- **sig_genes_24h.R**: Produces list of genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 24h, and for which exposure conditions
