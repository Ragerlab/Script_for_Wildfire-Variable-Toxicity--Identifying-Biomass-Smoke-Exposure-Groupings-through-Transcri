The first figure produced from this experimente is a heatmap of the concentration of chemical consituents of the exposure conditions, where both the exposure condition and chemical order reflect hierarchical clustering analyses. Additionally, plots of the WSS and silhouette profile are included, which were used for determining the optimal number of clusters of exposure conditions and chemicals. Two additional concentration heatmaps are generated with the exposure conditions organized to match the groupings from Experiment 2 (4h and 24h groupings).
