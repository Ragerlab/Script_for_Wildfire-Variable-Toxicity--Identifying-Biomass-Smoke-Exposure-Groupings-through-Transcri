The first figure produced from this experimente is a heatmap of the concentration of chemical consituents of the exposure conditions, where both the exposure condition and chemcical order reflect hierarchical clustering analyses. Two additional concentration heatmaps are generated with the exposure conditions organized to match the groupings from Experiment 2 (4h and 24h groupings).
