This experiment performs hierarchical clustering, based on a Euclidean distance, to group both the exposure conditions, and chemical constituents of the exposure conditions. A heatmap is generated from these results, as well as two additional heatmaps where the exposure conditions are organized to match the order of the exposure conditions from the analyses in Experiment 2, as opposed to the derived clusters from this experiment. A distance matrix of pairwise Euclidean distances between exposure conditions is also exported.
