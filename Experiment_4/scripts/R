The only script **chemistry_clustering**, runs hierarchical clustering on the scaled concentrations of chemical constituents, based on a Euclidean distance, to group the exposure conditions and the chemicals. A heatmap is produced from the results, and the pairwise distance matrix for the exposure conditions is exported. Additional heatmaps are made without clustering of the exposure conditions, which were instead organized to match the results from the analyses in Experiment_2.
