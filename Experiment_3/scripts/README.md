Scripts in this experiment include:

- 4h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_2.R: Runs hierarchical clustering on genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 2 using the Jaccard distance, then makes a heatmap of the results with exposure conditions organized to match the results in Experiment 2. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwise Jaccard similarities based on these conditions is also exported.
- 24h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_2.R: Runs hierarchical clustering on genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 24hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 2 using the Jaccard distance, then makes a heatmap of the results with exposure conditions organized to match the results in Experiment 2. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwise Jaccard similarities based on these conditions is also exported.
- 4h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_1_5.R: Runs hierarchical clustering on genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 1.5 using the Jaccard distance, then makes a heatmap of the results with exposure conditions organized to match the results in Experiment 2. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwise Jaccard similarities based on these conditions is also exported.
- 24h_transcriptomic_similarity_FC_1_5.R: Runs hierarchical clustering on genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4hs according to an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >= 1.5 using the Jaccard distance, then makes a heatmap of the results with exposure conditions organized to match the results in Experiment 2. A lower triangular matrix of the pairwise Jaccard similarities based on these conditions is also exported.
- sig_genes_4h.R: Produces list of genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 4h, and for which exposure conditions, for both sets of fold change filters 
- sig_genes_24h.R: Produces list of genes that are significantly differentially expressed at 24h, and for which exposure conditions, for both sets of fold change filters
