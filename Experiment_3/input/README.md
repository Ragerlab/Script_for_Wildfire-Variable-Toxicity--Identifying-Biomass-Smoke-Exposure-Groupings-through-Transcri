Input files for Experiment 3 scripts. Files span DESeq2 statistical results comparing lung tissue samples from mice exposed to various biomass burn conditions for 4h or 24h to 4h and 24h saline exposures. Exposure conditions include flaming and smoldering burns of red oak, peat, pine, pine needles, and eucalyptus, as well as positive inflammation control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, the lower triangular matrices from Experiment 2 are included as a reference so the exposure conditions in Experiment 3 heatmaps and matrices could be ordered in the same manner as those in Experiment 2.
