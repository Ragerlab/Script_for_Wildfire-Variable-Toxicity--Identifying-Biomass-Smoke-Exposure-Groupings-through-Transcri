Input files for Experiment 3 scripts are the same as those in Experiment 2, and thus can be found in *Experiment_2/input* with the exception of the lower triangular matrices from Experiment 2, which are included below. These serve as a reference so the exposure conditions in Experiment 3 heatmaps and matrices can be ordered in the same manner as those in Experiment 2.
