Experiment 3 identifies which genes are differentially expressed at 4hs and at 24hs using filters of an adjusted p-value <0.1 and a fold change >=2 and >=1.5. Gene expression for each condition is binarized according to whether the gene is significantly differentially expressed for that condition at the given timepoint. Hierearchical clustering is run to group the genes using the Jaccard distance, and heatmaps are produced with exposure conditions ordered to match the clusters derived in Experiment 2. Lower triangular matrices of pairwise Jaccard similarities between exposure conditions are also generated.
