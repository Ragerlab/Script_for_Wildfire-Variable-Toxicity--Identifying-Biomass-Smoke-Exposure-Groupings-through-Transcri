The script **potency_rank.R** calculates the number of DEGs and toxicity markers present for each exposure condition at 4hs and 24hs then inverse ranks them. For example, the condition out of the 11 possible exposure conditions with the highest number of DEGs at 24hs received a *DEG_24h_score* of 11, while the condition with the fewest DEGs at 24hs recieved a *DEG_24h_score* of 1. This schema was applied to calculate a *DEG_4h_score*, *DEG_24h_score*, *Tox_4h_score*, and *Tox_24h_score*. These values were summed, then ordered to provide and overall potency rank.
